                After the retinal image is created, the brain has to interpret where exactly the objects in the 
                image are located in 3 dimensional space. This is done through a variety of cues, some of which 
                only require the use of one eye (monocular), while others require two (binocular).</p>

                >If we know from experience how big an object is supposed to be, we can figure out how far away 
                it is by how large it appears when we see it. This is a cue called familiar size. Because we know 
                that human beings are several feet tall, we can ascertain that a person must be very far away if 
                they only look to be a few inches tall. Cues such as these are used extensively in artwork to 
                create a sense of realism.</p>

                light gets scattered by the atmosphere. Therefore, anything far off in the distance will appear 
                fainter than usual. This cue is called aerial perspective.</p>
